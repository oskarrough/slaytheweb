Slay the Web is a single player card game where you fight monsters to reach the end of the
web. It's a game of planning and knowing when to play which card.

Every turn you draw 5 cards from your draw pile. Cards cost energy to play, and you get 3
energy every turn.
Cards may deal damage to monsters, block enemy attacks or make them weak or vulnerable. They
can heal you and other things. You'll figure it out.

Beware, whenever you end your turn, the monsters take turn.

Should you manage to kill the monsters in a room before they end you, you'll proceed to the
next room. Maybe there will be rewards. Can you reach the end?

The game is inspired by Slay the Spire and the <a href="https://github.com/oskarrough/slaytheweb" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">source code is open</a>. It'd be wonderful with more contributors
